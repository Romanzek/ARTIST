Java2UMLClasses, Version 1.0.0

=================================

ABOUT
-----
- Java2UMLClass, component from the ARTIST Model Discovery Toolbox, allows automatically 
producing an UML Class model from initial Java source code via an intermediate Java source 
code model. The obtained UML Class model only covers the superstructure of the program and 
not the details of the expressions and statements (method bodies). These behavioural 
aspects are actually covered by the Java2UMLActivity component from the ARTIST Model 
Discovery Toolbox.

=========================================================================================

INCLUDED FUNCTIONALITIES
------------------------
- This component currently considers:
	* As input: Java source code or the Java model representing the Java source code 
	* As output: an UML Class model generated out of the input.

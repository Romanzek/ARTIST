Model-Based Tester (MBT)
===================================

Purpose
-------

When a software is migrated to new technologies or platforms, one important task is to ensure the quality of the software after the migration has been performed. In particular, two aspects have to be considered: it has to be evaluated whether the expected improvements of the migration have been accomplished and whether the migrated software still meets the original specification. This software focuses on the latter aspect. Here, it is investigated whether the migrated software still behaves the same as the original one in terms of functional requirements. Therefore, the behavioural equivalence of the original and the migrated software has to be ensured. More precisely, and since models are the central artefacts in the migration in the context of ARTIST, we use such models to also drive the behavioural equivalence at model level, which is complemented with the end-user based testing component.

            A value proposition is a statement that explains the relevancy of a service (how it solves customersâ€™ needs), quantifies its value (that is, how it delivers benefits) and identifies the competitive advantage (it explains how this service differentiates from existing services so the customer does not have the temptation to go to the competitors).

The value proposition may be unique for one product or service if it is addressed to one market. However, if the service is targeted to various market segments, they shall all receive a unique value proposition for the service.

            <intro>
               Study the needs of the customers you are targeting to, their motivation, their perspectives, etc. The main idea is to understand why they would buy your service and not others. This can be done by interviews, surveys or observation. Once that is clear, explain what the added value of this application is with respect to its competitor. This can be, later on, your sales pitch argument.

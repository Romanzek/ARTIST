   <intro>
      <description>
         <b>Use the Model Discovery Toolbox (MDT) to generate the minimum set of required low level initial models out of the legacy artefacts composing your system.</b>

         title="Classify the input legacy artefacts">
      <description>
         <b>Study and classify the legacy artefacts to be considered as inputs of the reverse engineering (and so model discovery) process. This is realized using the Taxonomy of Legacy Artifacts as being defined in ARTIST.</b>

         title="Inject the content of the legacy artefacts as initial models">
      <description>
         <b>Perform the bridge between the technical space defining the legacy artefacts and the modelware technical space, i.e., produce a set of initial models from the non-model-based legacy artefacts.</b>

         title="Map the initial models to models that conform to another metamodel">
      <description>
         <b>Transform the low-level initial models to other models, normally to promote genericity or change the representation format (i.e., to conform to standard metamodels). This task thus implements a direct syntactic (or structural) mapping (i.e., no interpretation or addition of data is performed).</b>

  <mainDescription>&lt;p>&#xD;
    The main objective of this process is to develop SaaS applications that fulfil the following characteristics using an&#xD;
    agile method:&lt;br />&#xD;
    • Support multitenancy. It should be designed to support concurrent accesses by multiple tenants and handle their&#xD;
    sessions in isolation&lt;br />&#xD;
    • High reusability: Services providers develop and deploy cloud services and expect that the services would be reused&#xD;
    by a large number of consumers.&lt;br />&#xD;
    • High availability: Cloud services are not just for specific users; rather they are for any potential unknown&#xD;
    consumers who may wish to use the services anytime and anywhere.&lt;br />&#xD;
    • High scalability: could services should be highly scalable even in the situation that an extremely high number of&#xD;
    services invocations and so their associated resource requests are requested.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;/p></mainDescription>

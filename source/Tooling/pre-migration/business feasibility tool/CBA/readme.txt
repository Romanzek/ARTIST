"This component presents a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) to provide decision makers with objective economic data on how much a migration would cost, 
compared to what the current system costs and what a new system developed from scratch would cost.
This CBA calculates when the invested money will 
be returned (Payback), the Net Present Value of the migration and the ROI of the migration in a 5 year long period

The current version provides the breakdown of 
the costs (one time and recurring) and benefits of the system, and which can be manually modified. Future versions will include a catalogue in the form of a drop-down 
list and transferred to the other worksheets. Additionally, the benefits included in the tab ""costs and benefits"" are only valid for Y1, having to manually insert 
the expected benefits after Y1. This will change in future versions, by asking the user the estimated increase of benefits after Y1.

Future versions will include:

- Catalogue of cost and benefits breakdown

- Implementation of recurring benefits

- Pricing strategy

- Balance sheet projections

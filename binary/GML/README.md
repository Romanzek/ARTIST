The GML components can be used to model migration goals in the context of UML software models. 
In this initial version we include a meta model, textual editors, and an initial version of the evaluation of the goal conditions.

Known issues
----
  * Datatype objects can not yet be compared, only primitive objects and enumeration literals can be used.
  * Derived properties are not yet calculated in the evaluation of the conditions.
